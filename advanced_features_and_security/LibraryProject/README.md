# Introduction to Django

Welcome to the **Introduction to Django** project! This project is designed to help you gain hands-on experience with Django, one of the most popular web frameworks for building robust web applications. By the end of this project, you will have a solid foundation in Django's core features, preparing you to develop more complex web applications.

## Objectives

### 1. Set Up Django Development Environment
   - **Install Django** and create a new Django project.
   - Familiarize yourself with the project’s default structure.
   - Run the development server and access the default Django page.

### 2. Implementing and Interacting with Django Models
   - **Create a Django app** within your project.
   - Define Django models with specified attributes.
   - Use Django’s ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) to perform and document CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations through the Django shell.

### 3. Utilizing the Django Admin Interface
   - Register your models with the Django admin interface.
   - Customize the admin interface to improve the management and visibility of your data.

## Project Overview

This structured approach will take you through Django’s essential features and workflows:
- **Environment Setup**: Set up Django in a virtual environment for isolated development.
- **Models and ORM**: Understand Django’s approach to database management by defining models and interacting with them through the ORM.
- **Admin Interface**: Learn to leverage Django’s built-in admin interface to manage your data easily.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have:
- **Python** installed (version 3.6 or later).
- **pip** (Python package manager).
- An **IDE or code editor** of your choice (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).
- **Virtual environment** tool (optional, but recommended for isolated development).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # Activate on macOS/Linux
   myenv\Scripts\activate     # Activate on Windows
